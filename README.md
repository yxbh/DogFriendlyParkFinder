# DogFriendlyParkFinder

A repo for extract dog friendly park names from council/city web pages and plotting them onto maps.

The project is WIP. It currently outputs a static HTML with the list of extracted coordinates that are then plotted onto Google Maps.

You will need to bring your own Google API key to run the projects.
